    1.  Datatype and Variables
                            |
                            |-->  Variables

    A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program. For example

    a = 30          # variable     = container to store a value
    b = "Sameer"    # keywords     = reserved words in python
    c = 31.65       # identifiers  = class/function/Variables name


                            |
                            |-->  Data Types
    primerly there are following data types in python

    1. Interger
    2. Floating point numbers
    3. Strings
    4. Booleans 
    5. None

    Python is the fantastic language that automatically identifies types of data for us

    a = 71              ====> identifies a as class <int>
    a = 65.32           ====> identifies b as class <float>
    c = "Sameer"        ====> identifies c as class <str>

    Rules for defining the variable name                ----> Also applies to other identifies

    ---> A variable contains alphabets,numbers and underscore.
    ---> A variable name can only start with an alphabets and underscores.
    ---> A variable name can't start with a digit.
    ---> No white space allowed to be used inside a variable name.


    Examples of a few Variables name are:- 
                                            sameer, _kadyan, one8, sameer_ etc;




                                            Operators in python

                            following are some common Operators in python 

                    1. Arithmatic operators ==> +,-,*,/ etc;
                    2. Assignment operators ==> =, +=, -=, etc;
                    3. Comparison operators ==> ==, =>, >, <, != etc;
                    4. Logical Operators    ==> and or not;


                        ------ type () function and typecasting 

                    type function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python

            a = 21;         type(a) ==> <class 'int'>
            b = "Sameer"    type(b) ==> <class 'str'>


    ****    A number can be converted into a string and vice verse ( if possible )
            There are many functions to convert one data type into another 

        1. str(43)      ==> "43"  ==> Interger to string conversion
        2. int("65")    ==> 65    ==> strngs to Integer conversion
        3. float(32)    ==> 32.00 ==> Integer to float conversion
                                                                ...........and So one



                        ------input() functions
                    
                    This function allow the user to take input from the keyboard as a string

                    a = input("Enter the name ");
                    
                    ** It is important to note that the output of input always is string ..

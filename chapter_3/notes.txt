    ** String **

    String is a data type in python. String is a sequence of a characters enclosed in quotes.
    We can primerly write string in these three ways

    1. Single quotes        ----> a = 'Sameer kadyan'
    2. Double quotes        ----> a = "Sameer kadyan"
    3. Triple quotes        ----> a = '''Sameer kadyan'''

    ** String Slicing **

    A string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the string
        Consider the following string.

        name = " S  a  m  e  e  r "  --> lenght = 5;
                 0  1  2  3  4  5|___->  that is indexis.
                -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1|

    The index in a string start from 0 to (lenght -1) in python. In order slice to string.
        We use the following syntax :-
            
            str = name [ind_start : ind_end]
                            |           |
                            |           |
                        first index    Last index
                          include       is not include

                str[0:3] out is ==>  Same
                str[1:3] out is ==>  am           # Because Last indexis is not 
                                                    included.
                
    Negative indices : Negative indices can also be used like -4,-3,-2,-1 etc.

                str[-4:-1] out is ==>  mee
                str[-6:-2] out is ==>  Same

    Note : [:4]  ====> [0:4]
           [1:]  ====> [1:last index]


    Slicing with skip value :
        we have a string :
            a = "Sameer kadyan"
                this string lenght is 12

                Now try skipping and slicing value 
                    a[1:11:3] ==> out is 'aeky'
                                    Because a is 1st index and we are going till 11 index that position is a and Now skipping 3 index sequencily and we got it.
